FactionsX
====================
This plugin aims to be a maintained version of FactionsUUID. The original authors of that plugin are no longer active and getting a
bug squashed is very difficult because they no longer have the time to maintain this project. Not only that, but I would also
like to make this a unique fork of Factions with its own unique twists and features.

Why you should use it
---------------------
* New commands
* New features
* Active support
* Very open to suggestions

Here is an example of the first major feature added into FactionsX
`/f friendlyfire (Alias /f ff)` - Toggle friendly fire between your faction. Only moderators and up can use this command
I plan on adding many more things onto this fork, and with your help and suggestions we can make a very nice fork of Factions.

Want to contribute?
-------------------
If you would like to contribute make sure you follow the basic style guidelines. For example, do not use allman-bracket styling

**1TBS (Correct Style)**
while (x == y) {
     something();
     somethingelse();
 }

**Allman (Incorrect Style)**
while (x == y)
 {
     something();
     somethingelse();
 }
 
 Just look through the repository source and make sure to follow the correct style. If you are not using this style on your other
 projects, then don't worry. It's not hard to get used to!
